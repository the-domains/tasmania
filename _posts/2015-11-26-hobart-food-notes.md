You can't just recommend eateries on their own as they have a variety of better and worse products/dishes in my opinion so instead here are dishes to try from specific places:

* Jackman and McRoss: savoury pies (especially lamb and rosemary) and hot cross buns (in season)
* Daci and Daci: selection of cakes and pastries especially chocolate concorde and a loaf of the fruit rustica (take back to your accommodation)
* 
Fullers: pot of chai and a book
* Shoebox cafe:
duck pancake
* 
Bathurst St Farmers Market:
garlic bagels with cream cheese (bring your own smoked salmon)
* 
Hill St:
whatever is the best quality/value mix in their fresh fruit and veges
plus smoked salmon (for your bagels above) and butter (for the rustica)
* 
Beach house cafe:
best thing here is an outdoor table on a sunny day and then a walk on the beach or park with the kids (assuming you have any) - breakfast and coffee are decent to wake up with first
